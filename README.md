I was the project leader for a group of four, working on the development of a website and software for a restaurant. Additionally, we created a software solution for the restaurant side using C# in Visual Studio. While I primarily focused on the website development, I won't be including the software in my examples.

Here are some example codes that demonstrate how a restaurant website could be created. Note that the database is not included.
These examples are intended to showcase my experimentation with the basics of web development.
